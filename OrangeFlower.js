let chapter1 = "Incredibly happy to be alive. Feelings of joy wrapping my heart tight, like a warm wilk ribbon touching its skin. (Listening to Pulse by IDER) I was sitting on the truck bed of my white 1991 Mistibushi pickup truck. I called for Qarrah, my favorite of playing the game of favorites, a black teenage cat who is the first generation of kittens. A crazy mother hopped onto the back of my dadâ€™s pickup at church on Sunday, in ___ a town 30 minutes north east from here. She gave birth to five kittens, Qarrah, Earl, Stella, Elizabeth, and another -who I am forgetting, maybe its four - in the illegal side addition to our main house. No one lived there, but it provided the roof and comfort for Crazy mom to give birth."
