// The directions given to the man are, for example, the following:
//
// ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
// or
// { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
//
// You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and then "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:
//
// ["WEST"]

let directions = ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"]
