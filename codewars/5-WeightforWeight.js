// Example:
//
// "56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
//
// When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings and not numbers: 100 is before 180 because its "weight" (1) is less than the one of 180 (9) and 180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9) it comes before as a string.
//
// All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

function orderWeight(strng) {
    // your code
    string.split(' ').map(num ->
}

// Test.it("Basic tests",function() {
//     Test.assertEquals(orderWeight("103 123 4444 99 2000"), "2000 103 123 4444 99")
//     Test.assertEquals(orderWeight("2000 10003 1234000 44444444 9999 11 11 22 123"), "11 11 2000 10003 22 123 1234000 44444444 9999")
// })})
